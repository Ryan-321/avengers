# Avengers University

## Summary
  This is a mock site to demonstrate my knowledge of Bootstrap.  In this site I demo Bootstrap basics, plus put together a modern single page scrolling website with module code.  Using angular and ng-include I split up my code in one file per section, which made it easier to manage.   I also made the UI more interesting by adding the animate.css plugin.  Please enjoy.

## Technologies used
  * Bootstrap
  * Jquery
    * fullPageJS plugin
  * Angular
    * UI Router
  * animate.css plugin
  * AWS - to host the images

## What I learned
  Originally, as my template engine I wanted to use handlebars or nested views in angular, but the more I researched them I found it not to be the best use case.  I also got pretty deep into the documentation for fullPageJS, its a nice plugin to have in my toolkit, offers a lot of customization.  Most of the frustration with this site involved on tying up everything together and doing it in such a way that the code was practical and made sense.  All and all it was a fun site to build and a good demo of some cool technologies.  

## What could be improved
  But, not without bugs.  The accordion and tab sections from BootStrap both add endpoints to the URL, which stay there if a link is not hit first.  The load times for the animate.css could be shortened, the user experience suffers because of this.
